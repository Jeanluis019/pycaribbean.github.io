    <h2>Who is David Tavarez?</h2>
    <p>I'm David Tavarez, an Open Source advocate, Software engineer, Security and privacy freak and Pentester enthusiast. I've been coding since I was 12 years old, I like to learn (as much as I can) how things are done and how much I can improve them. I help business to achieve their goals through Software. I'm really passionate about Community and Technology. I'm not really tight to a programming language, since I can code in Python, C#, PHP, Java, Javascript and C, and mre. When I'm not writing code, you can find me playing basketball, traveling with friends and family or doing political activism.</p>
