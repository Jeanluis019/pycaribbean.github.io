    <h2>Who is Veronica Hanus?</h2>
    <p>Before Veronica was a programmer, she was a researcher (she helped pick the Mars Curiosity Rover's landing site!) with an eye for process improvement. As she's taught herself web development, she's brought her research approach from her time at NASA-JPL & MIT into whatever she was learning. She loves exploring the web and teaching, and recently co-taught a PyCon tutorial on using web-scraping and modeling to predict Oscar winners. When she isn't learning how the web can be better for developers, she enjoys blogging, nerding out about documentation, and snuggling as many cats as possible.
