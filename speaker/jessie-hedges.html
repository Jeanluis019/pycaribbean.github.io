    <h2>Who is Jessie Hedges?</h2>
    <p>Jessie Hedges is a software developer at the Software Engineering Institute of Carnegie Mellon University and has 9 years of professional experience. Jessie has Bachelor's degrees in both Psychology and Computer Science from the University of Pittsburgh, and a Masters degree in Information Technology with a focus in Software Design and Management from Carnegie Mellon University. An avid believer in “baking empathy in,” Jessie tries to find ways to integrate this into software design, leading projects, onboarding and mentoring and process improvement. Jessie also serves on staff council for the university, using advocacy and community involvement to improve the staff experience for all people. Most recently, she has worked with other staff on drafting an inclusive parental leave policy proposal for all staff. When she's not working, she enjoys spending time with her dog, relaxing with a sheet mask, knitting, and practicing hygge in Pittsburgh's cold winter months.
