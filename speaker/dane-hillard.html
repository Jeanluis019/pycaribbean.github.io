    <h2>Who is Dane Hillard?</h2>
    <p>I like leveraging software development skills for good. During my short career I've had a chance to work in the fields of counterterrorism, cancer research, and education. I'm an unrepentant foodieâ€”read more about the upcoming [Piquant](https://piquantmag.com/about) if you like. [I made a music album](https://www.littleleviathan.com) once and [I make fashion and portraiture photography](https://www.danehillard.com) here and there.</p>
