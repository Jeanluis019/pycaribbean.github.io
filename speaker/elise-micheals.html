    <h2>Who is Elise Micheals?</h2>
    <p>Elise Micheals is a Sales Engineer for a tech company, working entirely remote and living her life as a digital nomad. Through her travels, she's been able to speak with teams from all walks of life, become the first Global leader for her company, volunteer her skills to help others obtain jobs and still be able to build her own business on the side. 

A former actress with a passion for learning, I strive to empower myself and others each and every day. I truly believe anything is possible and will continue to play my part in helping people achieve their dreams.</p>
