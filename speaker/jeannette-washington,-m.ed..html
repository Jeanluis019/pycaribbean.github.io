    <p>I am Jeannette Washington, M.Ed. a former Speech Language Pathologist with nearly a decade of experience working with students that exhibit special abilities. My expertise in the field of dyslexia has been solicited in The Washington Post alongside the cofounder of the Yale Center for Dyslexia & Creativity. Learning to code has ignited my passion for special populations in the tech industry. I have spoken at the Mississippi Dyslexia Symposium, A11y Camp Chicago and participated on a Diversity in WordPress Panel, to name a few. I can always be found tinkering or boasting the importance of accessibility, inclusivity, cognitive diversity and equity in the tech industry.</p>
