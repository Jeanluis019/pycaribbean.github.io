    <h2>Who is Oscar Cortez?</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Oscar! a full-stack web developer based in Nicaragua who's love building blazingly fast and elegant sites using Python, Django, and the "cool kids" frontend libraries. During my short career I had the chance to do extensive work in the fields of journalism, open data, machine learning, and education. When I'm not coding, I'm helping other people make unbelievably cool stuff via local meetups or mentorship.</p>
