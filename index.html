                    <p>The <b>Call For Proposals is now open</b> — the PyCaribbean 2016 conference in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, is accepting talks proposals!</p>
                    <!-- <h2>Where To Submit Your Proposal</h2>
                    <p>You can send an email to   <a href="mailto:proposals@pycaribbean.com">proposals@pycaribbean.com</a></p>
                    <p>We encourage prospective speakers to submit their proposals as early as possible.</p> -->
                    <h2>Guidelines For Proposal Submission</h2>
                    <p>Everyone who is interested is encouraged to submit a proposal, regardless of experience level. PyCaribbean aims to represent all the levels in the Python community having talks ranging from introductory to advanced. If you are reading this, and you are interested in speaking at PyCaribbean, we want you to submit a proposal.</p>

                    <h2>Talks Requirements</h2>
                    <p>Most talks are 30 minutes long, but we do offer a limited number of 45-minute slots for important topics that promise to benefit from a more extensive treatment. We aim to organize the schedule into "tracks", grouping talks with related topics and having them in the same room for consecutive sessions.</p>
                    <p>There is no official restriction on the topic that you propose for a talk session! Talks about Python or the Python community are most likely to line up with the interests of PyCaribbean's audience, and a key consideration that the talk selection committee will be thinking about is your talk’s ability to draw an audience.</p>
