    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>MySQL can now act as NoSQL Document Database and thanks to the new X Devapi you can use MySQL with having to embed Structured Query Language (SQL) strings into your beautiful code, normalize data, or set up relational tables. So you can code faster and and not worry as your data evolves. The API calls follow modern coding designs and is much easier to read for those without SQL skills. Plus see the new MySQL shell that has a built in Python interpreter or to allow you to easily manage your data.</p>
