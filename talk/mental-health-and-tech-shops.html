    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>It's easy to overcommit yourself in this industry- open source projects, conference planning and prep, tech meetups and our day job can take up a lot of our time and energy. There are so many "good" opportunities and projects to get involved in. But soon we find ourselves having too much of a good thing, and burnout follows. Sometimes we don't even realize we are overworking ourselves, because we've normalized that level of stress in our lives. How do we find a sustainable pace? This talk aims to provide guidance around finding balance, identifying stress and mental health concerns around burnout, and self care for those of us who do too much.</p>
