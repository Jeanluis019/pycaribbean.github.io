    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>It sounds simple to say that we will build one feature at a time, give it an API interface and allow it to connect with other features and microservices. The implementation is anything but simple. This talk explores how you can start migrating your existing features and services to a more modular, testable, and resilient system.

Since containers are not state-aware, how do you make changes to their presentation without needing to rebuild them entirely? With feature flags, your container can be stable and your presentation dynamic. How can you test a distributed architecture on your laptop? How can you simulate partial outages? This talk is going to touch on some of the best practices that you can use to bring new life to your brown fields.
