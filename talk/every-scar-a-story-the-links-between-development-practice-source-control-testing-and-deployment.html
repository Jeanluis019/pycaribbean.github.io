    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Scars result from trauma to our bodies.

Organizational scars are the same. The way we structure our organizations and systems is a reaction to things that went wrong before. We hope to avoid the same mistakes, so we put in a bunch of process and checks around the known problem. Eventually, the organization changes enough that we don't remember why that process exists, but we still keep it.

This talk explores some industry-standard practices around code repositories, branching, and why we handle code the way we do and what it says about the past traumas of our organization and how much "best practice" and tools affect each other.

Come listen if you're interested in examining something you take for granted, and thinking about how you can ask questions about your process.
