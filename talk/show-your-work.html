    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>In the workplace, sometimes we may feel that if our work is good, it will speak for itself, relieving us of that responsibility. However for women, research shows that even if the work speaks for itself, the credit is less likely to be given to us. So how do we get the credit for our good work against these challenges? How do we break through unconscious bias, and socialized silence? How can we be our own advocates?

In this presentation, attendees will hear several strategies for showing your work- tracking your own progress and contribution, and making it visible to those who make decisions about your future. How do you capture and take credit for the emotional and mental labor tasks of your office or project? How do you capture and take credit for the work you do that enables someone else's success? How do you report incremental progress when you are feeling stuck on an issue? All of the work you do, whether it is strictly tangible or not, is work, and should be valued as such. Learning how to report your activities and accomplishments is an important skill, because let's face it- nobody knows the work you do better than you!
