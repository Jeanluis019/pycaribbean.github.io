    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>How many times have you explained something to someone and felt confused? Or left an interview feeling like it could have gone a lot better? OR, maybe you felt it went well, and STILL didn't get hired? 
This talk breaks down the main communication skills necessary to become hired for more jobs, make your project more easily digestible to the untrained eye, and encourage social skills that set you above the rest. 

I work in tech, and this is something I've so desperately seen that's needed in the community. Having a lot of intellect can sometimes be more hurtful than helpful - My goal is to help the intellectual being able to have a personality to match the skills they've worked so hard to obtain.</p>
