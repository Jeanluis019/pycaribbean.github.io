    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Full talk version:
I will quickly (10 min) talk about why peer to peer tech could be so important for allowing users to decide what they want in the world, namely its potential to allow people to understand their tools better, control their data while knowing who it will be shared with(and who it won't be shared with), and avoiding predatory power structures. I will then describe(5 min) how the World Wide Web's protocol(HTTP) and the Internet works, and how mesh networking differs from this and allows communities to control the flow of their information. Finally, I will go over how to build a mesh network in Python using Raspberry PIs.
