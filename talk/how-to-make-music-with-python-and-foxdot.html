    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>This talk will start out with what is FoxDot and how to learn how FoxDot. From there we will walk through the construction of a song using FoxDot, from there we will go into what makes a song. This should provide something for individuals of all levels due to the live coding nature of this talk. Since making music with Python is something that beginner programmers can start with and advanced audiences could find interacting with Python in this way meaningful.

This talk will be live coded using the Python. There will also some slides that will be available on my website website.com/Making-Music-with-Python. All code samples will also be up on my GitHub.
