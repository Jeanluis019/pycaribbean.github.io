    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>In this workshop, we'll discuss the fundamental structure of programming and music with the use of Python. Python is a widely-used, and human readable programming language that allows users to quickly write code and solve problems. We'll discuss the structure and rules of music:

* Basic Music Theory and Notes
* The Major Scale
* The Minor Scale
* Chords

We'll take all of these concepts, and using the power of Python, re-create a famous pop song using only our computer! This talk is great for understanding the following concepts in Python:

* Basic types
* Classes with an OOP paradigm
* Data Structures
* Control Flow</p>
