    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Python 3.7 is here! In this talk, we'll explore several new standard library modules, new syntax features and changes, and other performance improvements and implementation changes and what it means for us as Python developers.</p><p>We'll also briefly chat about what exciting things didn't quite make it into 3.7, but we should expect to see in 3.8.</p>
