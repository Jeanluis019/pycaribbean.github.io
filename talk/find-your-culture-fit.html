    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Finding your next job can be a nerve-wracking process for many reasons. How do I evaluate a job offer for fairness and culture fit? Does this company have policies and offer benefits that are inclusive? Will I have the support and mentorship I need to advance my career? Will I be treated fairly with respect to promotions and opportunities? These are important topics to many of us who want to succeed in an industry whose prevailing demographics leave us underrepresented, 

Objectives:
* Present the current challenges women and other underrepresented groups face in the industry at all levels.
* Describe the visible indicators of companies that value and measure diversity and inclusion efforts.
* Discuss tactics and resources a job seeker can use to research a company's culture.
* Present examples of questions a job seeker can ask during the interview process, and learn how to evaluate common answers.
* Present ideas on how to be a better ally in the workplace to those in underrepresented groups.</p>
