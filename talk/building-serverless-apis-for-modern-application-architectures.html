    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Serverless platforms are rapidly gaining adoption and for good reason - it's a consumable and cost-effective way to host functions and capabilities. Developers are told they simply need to write code and let the platform take care of the rest. However, it's not always that straight-forward; most applications in production are complex and have restrictions to integrate with legacy systems.

In this talk, we'll cover the hybrid architectures that result from refactoring existing applications for modern workloads. In addition, we'll consider requirements that developers encounter when going to production like security and analytics for their serverless APIs. We'll tackle how serverless allows you to transform your applications from traditional to modern hybrid architectures.
